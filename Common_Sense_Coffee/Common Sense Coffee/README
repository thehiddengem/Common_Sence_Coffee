Welcome to Common Sense Coffee.

You can start exploring our website by going to the Home page, which includes interesting facts and information about our current promotions.

Next, check out our Menu page by clicking on "Menu" at the top of the navigation bar. Here you can find different kinds of beverages as well as coffee beans. If you don't feel like scrolling through the whole list, try our filtered options, which you can find on the left side of the screen. Click on the option that you want to explore to see only filtered options.

After you have chosen what you want to order, click on that option, and the Customization page for that item will appear. Feel free to customize your order however you want by choosing options from the dropdown menu. You can choose different flavors, toppings, sweeteners, sizes, add-ins (such as extra shot, almond milk, fat-free), etc.

Finally, click "Add to Order" to add the item with customizations to your order. You should see a pop-up message confirming that your order has been added to the cart. Now, you can either add more items or go straight to the Cart by clicking on the Cart image (or name) in the navigation bar.

On the Cart page, you can remove unwanted items by clicking "Remove," or if you are ready to check out, click "Proceed to Checkout" at the bottom of the page. Enter your card information and click "Pay Now" to complete your order. You will be redirected to the Confirmation page where you will receive your confirmation number as well as the estimated delivery date.

To return to the Home page, click the "Home" button in the middle of the screen or in the navigation bar. You can also explore the About Us page and Forums anytime you like.
